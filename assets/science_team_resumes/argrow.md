## Schaden Leadership Endowed Professor & Dept. Chair Ann and H.J. Smead Dept. of Aerospace Engineering Sciences, [University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/brian-argrow)

## Research Interests:
Dr. Argrow is the Schaden Leadership Professor and Chair of the Ann and H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, Director of the Integrated Remote & In Situ Sensing Program, and Founding Director (Emeritus) of the Research & Engineering Center for Unmanned Vehicles. His areas of research include the design and deployment of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) with emphasis on atmospheric sensing systems. 

## Role in Investigation:
Student collaboration lead.  Integrated Remote & In-Situ Sensing Program (IRISS) provides research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training (SMART) program.

## Experience Related to the Investigation:
In 2010, he led the first UAS team to collect thermodynamic data in a tornadic supercell thunderstorm during the second Verification of the Origin of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX-2). In 2020, his UAS team collected thermodynamic, wind, and turbulence measurements for the NOAA Atlantic Tradewind Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Interaction Campaign (ATOMIC) in the tropical North Atlantic east of Barbados. His UAS teams have also made multiple deployments to Oliktok Point, AK to collect sea, air, and cloud measurements. He is principle investigator of an AFOSR Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) that is using balloon-borne payloads to routinely measure turbulence and particulate distributions in the middle stratosphere. He currently serves on the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, and has served on the USAF Scientific Advisory Board, as well as several NASA and NOAA advisory boards.
